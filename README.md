# YouTube-Downloader With PyQt5 and Pytube

In this program we use PyQt5 library and from pytube library import YouTube.We want to use this library and the link of a YouTube post to download it as a video or audio file. Finally, save the downloaded file in a directory.

!(But in my project downloading is not done well. and I get a not-response error!)
